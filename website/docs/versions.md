After you release an app, or if it's rejected during the [review process](./review-process.md), you won't be able to make changes to the app until you create a new version of it.

## How versioning works

You can create a new version of an app if it's in either of the following states:

- Released
- Rejected

The new version of an app is a complete copy of the existing app, including its metadata and extensions. Nothing is lost between versions.

If you create a new version of a **Released** app, both versions of the app will appear in the Developer Portal _until_ the new version is released. When the new version is released, the previous version will no longer be displayed.

If you create a new version of a **Rejected** app, the new version of the app will be displayed in place of the previous version.

:::note  
 The previous versions of apps are not deleted. They're just hidden.

## Creating a new version

To create a new version of an app:

1.  Log in to the Developer Portal.
2.  Navigate to the **Your apps** page.
3.  Click **Create a new version**.

You'll immediately be taken to the new version of the app.

:::note  
 If the option isn't available, make sure the app is in the or state.

In this guide, we're going to get up-and-running with developing apps for Canva.

## Step 1: Create an app via the Developer Portal

1.  Log in to the Developer Portal.
2.  Click **Your apps**.
3.  Click **Create an app**.
4.  Enter a name for the app in the **App name** field.
5.  Agree to the [terms and conditions](https://about.canva.com/policies/developer-terms/).
6.  Click **Create app**.

## Step 2: Add one or more extensions to the app

After creating an app, you'll be prompted to add an _extension_ to it.

An extension is what allows an app to hook into different parts of the Canva editor.

There are three types of extensions:

| Type                               | Description                             |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| [Content](./content-extensions.md) | Add third-party content to Canva.       |
| [Editing](./editing-extensions.md) | Add image effects and filters to Canva. |
| [Publish](./publish-extensions.md) | Add publishing destinations to Canva.   |

You can add more than one extension to an app. You cannot, however, add multiple extensions of the same type.

To get up-and-running with each type of extension, check out the quick start guides:

- [Quick start for content extensions](./content-extensions/quick-start.md)
- [Quick start for editing extensions](./editing-extensions/quick-start.md)
- [Quick start for publish extensions](./publish-extensions/quick-start.md)

## Step 3: Submit the app for review

If you'd like to distribute an app via the [Apps Directory](https://canva.com/apps). you'll need to submit it for review. This review process will ensure that the app meets our quality standards.

To submit an app for review:

1.  Navigate to an app within the Developer Portal.
2.  Click **Submit for review**
3.  Agree to the terms and conditions.
4.  Click **Submit**.

If your app doesn't pass the review process, feedback will be provided via the **Feedback** page.

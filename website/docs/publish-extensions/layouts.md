When configuring a publish extension, there are three _listing layouts_ to choose between:

- [Default](./default-layout.md)
- [List](./list-layout.md)
- [Nested](./nested-layout.md)

The layout you choose will have a significant impact on the end-user experience and the routes the extension will need to support.

Refer to the linked topics for more information about each layout.

One of Canva's goals is to empower the world to design. In pursuit of this goal, we allow third-party developers to create _apps_ and then distribute them to our millions of users via the [Apps Directory](https://canva.com/apps).

## What is an app?

An app can be thought of as a plugin that adds content or functionality to Canva. They run entirely within the browser and are built with standard web technologies, such as REST APIs and JavaScript.

Some examples of apps include:

- Duotone
- Flickr
- HubSpot

You can find more examples at [canva.com/apps](https://canva.com/apps).

## What can apps do?

By hooking into the _extension points_ that Canva provides, an app can:

- [Add third-party content to Canva](content-extensions.md).
- [Add image effects and filters to Canva](editing-extensions.md).
- [Add publishing destinations to Canva](publish-extensions.md).

If you're ready to develop an app, check out [the quick start guide](quick-start.md).
